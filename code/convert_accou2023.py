"""Prepare the Accou et al. 2023 SparrKULee dataset for re-hosting on NEMAR.

SparrKULee is already published in BIDS-EEG format on the KU Leuven Research
Data Repository (DOI: 10.48804/K3VSND), so this script is NOT a full
converter — it only applies the minimal fixes needed so the dataset passes
the modern BIDS validator and to **exclude the 5 subjects whose files are
access-restricted**.

Restricted subjects (data not publicly downloadable, returns HTTP 403 from
the KU Leuven Dataverse):

  - sub-019, sub-020, sub-021, sub-022, sub-026

Researchers who need these subjects must request access directly from the
authors (sparrkulee@kuleuven.be) and download them from the official KU
Leuven Dataverse page at https://doi.org/10.48804/K3VSND.

Fixes applied:
  1. Remove directories for restricted subjects and mark them in
     `participants.tsv` with an `exclusion_note` column.
  2. Add a prominent warning to `README` and `dataset_description.json`
     describing the exclusion.
  3. Fix `participants.tsv` age column: the age is stored as a string
     range (e.g. "21 to 23"); we move it to a new `age_range` column and
     set `age` to n/a. Also update `participants.json` accordingly.
  4. Move per-session `remarks/` text files out of the BIDS subject
     hierarchy and into `/code/remarks/` (the BIDS validator does not
     recognise arbitrary `remarks/` folders inside `sub-XX/ses-YY/`).
  5. Keep the original `*.bdf.gz` EEG files — they are legal in BIDS when
     whitelisted via `.bidsignore` (the upstream dataset already does
     this), and decompressing would roughly double the on-disk footprint.

Usage:

    python convert_accou2023.py --input /tmp/accou2023
